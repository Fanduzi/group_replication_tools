Additional tools and scripting to support Group Replication 
=============================
This version of GR_sys_view_forProxysql_v1.sql
Is optimise to work with PS and ProxySQL v2.x

It will create views and functions in the SYS schema, to interrogate in the most efficient way the Group Replication cluster about its state.


All the credit goes to @lefred who did the first version
